  ##   To use TCP, set endpoint = "tcp://[ip]:[port]"
  ##   To use environment variables (ie, docker-machine), set endpoint = "ENV"
  endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"

  ## Set the source tag for the metrics to the container ID hostname, eg first 12 chars

  ## Containers to include and exclude. Globs accepted.
  ## Note that an empty array for both will include all containers

  ## Whether to report for each container per-device blkio (8:0, 8:1...) and
  ## network (eth0, eth1, ...) stats or not
  perdevice = false

  ## Whether to report for each container total blkio and network stats or not
  total = false

  ## Specifies for which classes a total metric should be issued. Total is an aggregated of the 'perdevice' values.
  ## Possible values are 'cpu', 'blkio' and 'network'
  ## Total 'cpu' is reported directly by Docker daemon, and 'network' and 'blkio' totals are aggregated by this plugin.
  ## Please note that this setting has no effect if 'total' is set to 'false'

  ## Which environment variables should we use as a tag
  ##tag_env = ["JAVA_HOME", "HEAP_SIZE"]

  ## docker labels to include and exclude as tags.  Globs accepted.
  ## Note that an empty array for both will include all labels as tags
